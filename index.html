                Hello! My name is Elina and I have been a Software Project Manager for
                over a decade! However, I have never written my own software, so I
                decided to join Code the Dream. I'm excited to see a different side of
                the Software I've worked on, catch similarities and learn to speak my
                Engineers' language and became a better project manager.
