        <p class="center">
          Greetings and welcome to my portfolio webpage! <br />
          I have been a Technical Program Manager for over a decade, during
          which I have managed programs for a large-scale telecommunications
          company, as well as several start-ups. I typically do not write my own
          software, so I decided to join Code the Dream to get an Engineer's
          perspective on the projects I typically oversee, as well as begin
          building my own. <br />I'm looking forward to seeing a different side
          of the Software I'm managing, as well as see my personal ideas to
          fruition. <br /><br />
          Check out my experience below, and feel free to reach out and send me
          a message over Linkedin if you think we could be a great fit!
        </p>
